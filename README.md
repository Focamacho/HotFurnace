# Hot Furnace <a href="https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/hot-furnace"><img src="http://cf.way2muchnoise.eu/full_395615_downloads.svg"></a>
Speed up your furnace just by using better fuels.

This mod makes the furnaces faster depending on the fuel used.<br>
For example: coal is faster than wood, and lava is faster than coal.


Speed is calculated from how many ticks the fuel lasts in the furnace.<br>
You can set custom values for specific fuels in the config file.
